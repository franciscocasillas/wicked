# Wicked
This project was built for Wicked, a bakery shop where clients can create custom cakes. For this project I also designed the bakery's interface so that my client can manage placed orders and their specifications.

## Design

**Design tools used:** Sketch, Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer

For this project I was given the task of creating the whole brand's identity as well as the website's design. I started the design process using the cake photos[^1] given to me as the starting point, and from there I built the rest.
